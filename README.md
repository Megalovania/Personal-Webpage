# Personal-Webpage: Cory Cizauskas

So much has changed since I began working on this project.

Old Webpage Proposal
For this personal webpage, I'll be proposing two main content panels supported by several extra features accessible from all pages
but the main. When the site is first accessed, the home page will contain a photographic background of something to be determined
along with a quote centered on the page which will also be determined at a later time. The quote will be randomly selected from a
set each time the main page is accessed. Perhaps the background will use the Photo Album feature I wish to include by creating a
background from multiple photographs and updating them accordingly. The user will find a continue button below the quote that will
lead to the Blog section of my page.

The blog section of this site will continue to use the photograph background from the home page but with a grey tint. I have nothing
special planned for this blog section other than the ability to create posts from text and images. To the right of the blog, there
will a "Recent News" section which copies headlines and article links from The New York Times. Along the left side, I'd like to
include a small display of recent photos I added to the site, each expanding when clicked by the user. A menu bar will be at the top
to allow navigation back to the main page and to an "About Me" page.

The "About Me" page will be set up similarly to the blog page, including the Recent News and Album sections. It will use the center
space previously used by the blog to summarize my work history and skills. At the bottom of the page, there will be a Link saying
"Download Resume Here" which will prompt the user for a one-time-only password to be provided at my leisure. This is meant to protect
private information I only want potential employers/colleagues to see.

Extra Idea: I don't know if this would be possible, but perhaps a discus comment section could be created for each blog post?
The only drawback I see to this is that I would need to make a page for each blog post.
